# Is natural history more fundamental than statistics?

A couple of weeks ago at iDiv I had an exchange with Jonathan Chase about the importance of natural history, and whether it is more fundamental than statistics. I was highlighting the merits of statistics, Jon was arguing for fundamental importance of natural history. To quote Jon quoting Evelyn Hutchinson:

> A quote Hutchinson wrote in 1975 about the importance of Natural history may shed some light on why I think that more fundamental than any statistical mumbo-jumbo, any good quantitative ecologist needs to be a good natural historian first…The quote is as relevant today (or more so) than when he wrote it 40 years ago:

>>  “*Modern biological education, however, may let us down as ecologists if it does not insist…that a wide and quite deep understanding of organisms, past and present, is as basic a requirement as anything else in ecological education.  It may be best self-taught, but how often is this difficult process made harder by a misplaced emphasis on a quite specious modernity.  Robert MacArthur really knew his warblers.*”

I replied that dismissing statistics as mumbo-jumbo or specious modernity is unjust. Yes, there are bad statistical applications out there, and stats can be used to conceal, exaggerate, or to just make things too complex, but that is a problem of bad statisticians, it is not an inherent flaw of statistics. 

Today I see that neither of us (including Hutchinson) actually provided any substantial arguments for why natural history or statistics should really be that fundamental. We haven't continued the conversation, but the issue kept my brain busy nevertheless. Today I have this to say:

Any understanding of organisms begins with observation of nature and/or experimentation with it. The observations and experiments then reveal rules (patterns, trends, laws) and exceptions to the rules, we are surprised or bored, we learn, we do more observations and experiments, we are surprised or bored, we learn, and so on. Children do it. People who do this professionally are scientists.

Now, in this process, where exactly is natural history and where is statistics? I'd say that Natural history, the deep understanding of nature, is *the pile of rules and exceptions* that one accumulates during the cycle of observation, experimentation and learning. I'd also say that Statistics is *the way to identify the rules and exceptions* among all the observations, and it does not really matter if this happens in children's brain, or in R.

From this perspective, it seems that both statistics and natural history are really important, and their relative importance is perhaps a matter of taste. But are they also fundamental (= foundational)? Or is there something even more fundamental that keeps them both alive?  Some infinite and renewable source of energy driving the cycle of observation, experimentation and learning.

I propose that such fundamental thing that keeps both natural history and statistics alive is curiosity. Simple curiosity. Maybe curiosity is the most fundamental basic skill that we, as scientists, should really profess and master. Deep knowledge and the ability to separate rules from exceptions will then come as a byproduct.
